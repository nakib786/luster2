## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme States
1. **Light**: Traditional light theme with original design
2. **Dark**: Enhanced dark theme with improved contrast
3. **System**: Automatically follows OS preference

### Color Strategy
- **Light theme**: Original color palette maintained
- **Dark theme**: 
  - Background: Deep slate tones (oklch 0.08-0.12)
  - Text: High contrast whites (oklch 0.98)
  - Accents: Brighter variants of brand colors
  - Borders: Semi-transparent overlays for depth

### Performance Considerations
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Efficient theme switching without re-renders
- **Context optimization**: Minimal re-renders on theme changes
- **Transition optimization**: Hardware-accelerated transitions
- **Bundle size**: Minimal impact on bundle size

## Browser Support
- **Modern browsers**: Full support with CSS custom properties
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **System theme**: Supported in all modern browsers

## Testing
- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ ESLint warnings only (non-breaking)
- ✅ Theme persistence working
- ✅ System theme detection functional
- ✅ All components responsive to theme changes

## Usage
Users can toggle between themes using the theme toggle button available in:
- Desktop navigation (top right)
- Mobile navigation (next to hamburger menu)

The theme preference is automatically saved and will be restored on subsequent visits.
